# backoffice-workout-editor Specification

## Purpose

Gives trainers and admins one backoffice screen per workout, showing the exercise catalog, the workout with its
exercises, and the configuration of the exercise they select, as the base of the workout editor.

## Requirements

### Requirement: The workout screen is reached by the workout id

The backoffice SHALL offer a signed-in screen at `/workout?id=<workout id>` that reads that workout and the exercise
catalog once on opening. A visitor without a session SHALL end on `/login`.

#### Scenario: Trainer opens a workout

- **WHEN** a trainer with a stored session opens `/workout?id=w-1`
- **THEN** exactly one read of workout `w-1` and one read of the exercise catalog are sent
- **AND** the screen is shown beside the navigation drawer

#### Scenario: Visitor without a session

- **WHEN** a visitor with no stored session opens `/workout?id=w-1`
- **THEN** the visitor ends on `/login` and no workout is read

### Requirement: The screen has a page header

Above the cards, the screen SHALL show the page heading "Editar entrenamiento" and a "Volver" link to
`/assigned-plans`. The "Guardar" button that saves the workout's data SHALL sit inside the properties card, after its
fields.

#### Scenario: Header shown

- **WHEN** workout "Pierna" is loaded
- **THEN** the page heading reads "Editar entrenamiento"
- **AND** a "Volver" link leads to `/assigned-plans`
- **AND** the properties card shows "Guardar" after Descripción

### Requirement: Guardar checks the workout's data and sends nothing when invalid

On "Guardar", the screen SHALL check the card's fields structurally and, if any fails, SHALL show the message under
that field and SHALL NOT send any request. Nombre is required and at most 256 characters after trimming; Descripción
is optional and at most 1024 characters; Semana always holds a week, so it is never reported.

#### Scenario: Blank name

- **WHEN** the user clears Nombre and clicks "Guardar"

#### Scenario: Description too long

- **WHEN** the description has 1025 characters and the user clicks "Guardar"
- **THEN** Descripción shows "No puede superar los 1024 caracteres." and no request is sent

### Requirement: Guardar replaces the workout's editable data

When the fields are valid, "Guardar" SHALL send exactly one update of the workout with its id, the trimmed name, the
Wednesday of the selected week as its date, the trimmed description or none when blank, and the athlete and trainer
exactly as they were read. While it is in progress, "Guardar" SHALL be disabled.

confirmation. When it fails, the screen SHALL show the message for the error code and keep the typed values.

#### Scenario: Saved

- **WHEN** the API accepts the update with the name "Pierna B"
- **THEN** "Entrenamiento guardado." is shown and the Nombre field holds "Pierna B"

#### Scenario: Rejected

- **WHEN** the API answers 403
- **THEN** "No tienes permiso para realizar esta acción." is shown
- **AND** the fields keep the typed values

### Requirement: Catalog filters combine and are local

Typing SHALL keep only exercises whose name in the active language contains the text, ignoring case and accents.
Selecting a pill SHALL keep only exercises of that type, body part or muscle; selecting the selected pill again SHALL
clear it. All the filters SHALL apply together, and filtering SHALL NOT send any request. No match SHALL show "Ningún
ejercicio coincide con el filtro.". The filters SHALL be kept when the catalog dialog is closed and opened again on the
same screen.

#### Scenario: Filter by text

- **WHEN** the user types "sentadi"
- **THEN** only exercises whose name contains "sentadi" (such as "Sentadilla") are shown

### Requirement: Each exercise shows its name, body part and muscle

Each exercise, in the catalog and in the workout, SHALL show its name in the active language and, below it, labels with
its body part and muscle translated. An unknown code SHALL be shown as it comes. A workout exercise SHALL take these
from the catalog exercise with the same id; with no match it SHALL show its exercise id as the name and no labels.

screen, filled with that colour; an unknown body part SHALL use the neutral colour. The muscle label SHALL use the
colour of the exercise's body part as its outline only. The body-part and muscle filter pills SHALL use the same
colours, outlined while unselected and filled while selected.

#### Scenario: Chest and legs differ

- **WHEN** a chest exercise and a legs exercise are shown

- **THEN** it is filled with the legs colour, the other body-part pills are outlined in their colours, and the muscle
  pills are outlined in the legs colour

### Requirement: The catalog hides exercises already in the workout

The catalog SHALL NOT list an exercise that is already saved in the workout, so the same exercise cannot be added
twice.

#### Scenario: Saved exercise hidden

- **WHEN** the workout already holds "Sentadilla"
- **THEN** the catalog does not list "Sentadilla"

#### Scenario: Added exercise leaves the catalog

- **WHEN** the API accepts the addition of "Prensa de piernas" and the user opens the catalog again

renumbering it. It SHALL then send exactly one reorder of the workout with the catalog ids of every saved exercise in
the new order. On success the list SHALL keep the new order.

#### Scenario: Exercise moved down

- **WHEN** the workout lists "Sentadilla" then "Press banca" and the user drops "Sentadilla" after "Press banca"
- **THEN** "Press banca" is listed as 1 and "Sentadilla" as 2 before the API answers
- **AND** exactly one reorder is sent with the ids of "Press banca" and "Sentadilla" in that order

#### Scenario: Reorder accepted

- **WHEN** the API accepts the reorder
- **THEN** the list keeps the new order and no error is shown

### Requirement: Dropping an exercise at its own position sends nothing

Dropping an exercise where it was, or cancelling the drag, SHALL leave the order unchanged and SHALL NOT send a request.

- **THEN** the order is unchanged and no reorder is sent

#### Scenario: Drag cancelled

- **WHEN** the user picks up "Sentadilla", moves it and presses Escape
- **THEN** the order is unchanged and no reorder is sent

### Requirement: A refused reorder restores the previous order

When the reorder fails, the list SHALL go back to the order it had before the drop, and the message for the error code
SHALL be shown in the exercises card.

#### Scenario: Reorder rejected

- **WHEN** the API answers 409 to the reorder
- **THEN** the exercises are listed in the order they had before the drop
- **AND** "La operación entra en conflicto con el estado actual." is shown

### Requirement: Dragging is disabled while a reorder is in progress

While a reorder request is in progress, every drag handle SHALL be disabled, so a second reorder cannot start before
the first one is answered.

#### Scenario: Reorder in progress

- **WHEN** a reorder has been sent and the API has not answered yet
- **THEN** every "Reordenar ejercicio" handle is disabled

### Requirement: Exercises can be reordered from the keyboard

A focused drag handle SHALL pick up its exercise with Space or Enter. The arrow keys SHALL move it across the rows of

Removing a set SHALL take it out of the list only; nothing is sent until "Guardar".

#### Scenario: Several sets listed

- **WHEN** an exercise has the sets 2 × 15, 1 × 10–12 and 1 × max reps

Below the list, a form SHALL ask for Series, Tipo, and the target fields the type needs: Valor for repetitions and
seconds, Valor and Máximo for a repetition range, none for max reps. "Añadir serie" SHALL check the form structurally,
show the message under each invalid field, and otherwise append the set to the end of the list and empty the form.

#### Scenario: Set added
