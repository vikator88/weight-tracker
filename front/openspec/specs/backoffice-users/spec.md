# backoffice-users Specification

## Purpose

Lets administrators see every user in one searchable, filterable table in the backoffice and create users of any role
from it, without leaving the screen.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Signed-in staff reach the users screen

The backoffice SHALL offer a signed-in screen at `/users` with the heading "Todos los usuarios", shown with the
navigation drawer and header like every signed-in screen. A visitor without a session SHALL end on `/login`.

#### Scenario: Admin opens the screen

- **WHEN** an admin with a stored session opens `/users`
- **THEN** the heading "Todos los usuarios" is shown with the drawer and header

#### Scenario: Visitor without a session

- **WHEN** a visitor with no stored session opens `/users`
- **THEN** the visitor ends on `/login`

### Requirement: The screen lists every user the API returns

On opening, the screen SHALL request the users once and SHALL show one table row per active user, in the order the API
returns them, until the visitor searches, picks a profile or shows inactive users. Inactive users SHALL be hidden until
the visitor turns on "Mostrar inactivos".

#### Scenario: Users shown

- **WHEN** the screen opens and the API returns three active users
- **THEN** the table shows three rows in that order

#### Scenario: Inactive users hidden on load

- **WHEN** the screen opens and the API returns two active users and one inactive user
- **THEN** the table shows only the two active users
- **AND** the "Mostrar inactivos" switch is off

### Requirement: Each row shows the full name, email and profile

Each row SHALL show the user's name and surname joined in one "Nombre completo" cell, the email, and the translated
profile (Usuario, Entrenador or Administrador). When both name and surname are empty, the cell SHALL show "—".

#### Scenario: Row content

- **WHEN** a user "Ana" "García", "ana@example.com", role `TRAINER` is listed
- **THEN** the row shows "Ana García", "ana@example.com" and "Entrenador"

#### Scenario: User without a name

- **WHEN** a user with empty name and surname is listed
- **THEN** the "Nombre completo" cell shows "—"

### Requirement: The search field filters by email, name or surname

The screen SHALL show one search field above the table. While it holds text, only rows whose email, name or surname
contain that text SHALL be shown, ignoring case and accents. It SHALL NOT send any request.

#### Scenario: Search by surname

- **WHEN** the visitor types "garcia" and a user's surname is "García"
- **THEN** that user's row is shown and rows that do not match are hidden
- **AND** no request is sent

#### Scenario: Search cleared

- **WHEN** the visitor empties the search field
- **THEN** every loaded row is shown again

### Requirement: Profile pills filter by role

The screen SHALL show one pill per profile (Usuario, Entrenador, Administrador) above the table. Selecting a pill SHALL
show only users of that role. Selecting it again SHALL clear the filter. At most one pill SHALL be selected. Pills and
search SHALL combine.

#### Scenario: Pill selected

- **WHEN** the visitor selects "Entrenador"
- **THEN** only users with role `TRAINER` are shown and "Entrenador" is shown as selected

#### Scenario: Pill cleared

- **WHEN** "Administrador" is selected and the visitor types "ana"
- **THEN** only admins whose email, name or surname contain "ana" are shown

### Requirement: The screen shows loading, empty, no-match and failure states

While the users load, the screen SHALL show a loading placeholder instead of the table. An empty list SHALL show
"Todavía no hay usuarios.". Filters that match nothing, including the hidden inactive users, SHALL show "Ningún usuario
coincide con la búsqueda.". A failed load SHALL show the error for its code with a retry action.

#### Scenario: Empty list

- **WHEN** the API returns no users
- **THEN** "Todavía no hay usuarios." is shown instead of rows

#### Scenario: No match

- **WHEN** users are loaded and the search matches none
- **THEN** "Ningún usuario coincide con la búsqueda." is shown instead of rows

#### Scenario: Only inactive users

- **WHEN** the API returns only inactive users and "Mostrar inactivos" is off
- **THEN** "Ningún usuario coincide con la búsqueda." is shown instead of rows

#### Scenario: Load fails and is retried

- **WHEN** the listing fails

### Requirement: Only admins can open the creation modal

For an `ADMIN`, the screen SHALL show an "Añadir usuario" button above the table. Activating it SHALL open the "Nuevo
usuario" modal and SHALL NOT send any request. For a `TRAINER`, neither the button nor the modal SHALL be rendered.

user rules and, on any violation, SHALL show the message under the field and SHALL NOT send any request. Empty optional

again. Reopening the modal SHALL show empty fields.

#### Scenario: User created

users to the table in the API's order. Turning it off SHALL hide them again. The switch SHALL combine with the search
and the profile pills, and SHALL start off every time the screen opens.

#### Scenario: Switch turned on

- **WHEN** the API returns two active users and one inactive user and the visitor turns on "Mostrar inactivos"
- **THEN** the table shows all three users in the API's order

#### Scenario: Switch turned off again

### Requirement: Admins reach activation from each row

For an `ADMIN`, each row SHALL end with an actions button labelled "Acciones de <name>". It opens a menu that offers
"Desactivar" for an active user and "Activar" for an inactive one. The caller's own row SHALL have no actions button.
Any other role SHALL see no actions column, button or menu.

#### Scenario: Inactive user's menu

- **WHEN** the switch is on and an admin opens the actions of an inactive user
- **THEN** the menu offers "Activar" and not "Desactivar"

#### Scenario: Own row

- **WHEN** an admin views the table and their own user is listed
- **THEN** their own row has no actions button

### Requirement: Activation is confirmed before it is sent

Choosing "Desactivar" or "Activar" SHALL open a confirmation dialog naming the user (full name, or email when there is
none) and stating the effect, and SHALL send nothing until confirmed. Deactivation SHALL use a destructive confirm
button. "Cancelar" SHALL close the dialog without a request.

#### Scenario: Cancelled

- **WHEN** the dialog is open and the admin chooses "Cancelar"
- **THEN** the dialog closes and no activation request is sent

### Requirement: A confirmed activation change refreshes the list

Confirming SHALL send the matching operation for that user. On success the dialog SHALL close, a success message
("Usuario desactivado." or "Usuario activado.") SHALL show, and the users SHALL be requested again. With the switch off,
a deactivated user then leaves the table.

#### Scenario: User deactivated

- **WHEN** an admin confirms the deactivation of an active user and it succeeds
- **THEN** the dialog closes, "Usuario desactivado." is shown and the users are requested again

#### Scenario: User activated

- **WHEN** the switch is on, an admin confirms the activation of an inactive user and it succeeds
- **THEN** the dialog closes, "Usuario activado." is shown and the users are requested again

### Requirement: A failed activation change keeps the dialog open

On failure the dialog SHALL stay open and show the message for the error code, and the confirm button SHALL be usable
again. Closing the dialog after a `CONFLICT` or `NOT_FOUND` failure SHALL request the users again, because the list is
out of date.

#### Scenario: Already in that state

- **WHEN** the confirmation fails with `CONFLICT`
- **THEN** the dialog stays open and shows "El usuario ya estaba en ese estado. Recarga la lista."

#### Scenario: User no longer exists

- **WHEN** the confirmation fails with `NOT_FOUND`
- **THEN** the dialog stays open and shows "Este usuario ya no existe."

#### Scenario: Not allowed

- **WHEN** the confirmation fails with `FORBIDDEN`
- **THEN** the dialog stays open and shows the existing message for `FORBIDDEN`

#### Scenario: Closed after a stale-list failure

- **WHEN** the confirmation failed with `CONFLICT` and the admin closes the dialog
- **THEN** the users are requested again
