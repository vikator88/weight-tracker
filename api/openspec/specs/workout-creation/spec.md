# workout-creation Specification

## Purpose

Lets authenticated callers create a workout, and decides who owns it and who prescribed it from the caller's role and the request.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Authenticated callers may create a workout
The system SHALL expose `POST /workouts` to every authenticated caller, whatever their role. A request without a valid access token SHALL be rejected with `401 Unauthorized` and create nothing.

#### Scenario: No token
- **WHEN** a caller sends `POST /workouts` without an access token
- **THEN** the response is `401 Unauthorized`
- **AND** no workout is created

#### Scenario: Invalid token
- **WHEN** a caller sends `POST /workouts` with a malformed or wrongly signed access token
- **THEN** the response is `401 Unauthorized`
- **AND** no workout is created

### Requirement: The workout date is required and stored without time
The request SHALL carry `workoutDate` as a calendar date. A request without it, or with a value that is not a date, SHALL be rejected with `400 Bad Request`. The created workout SHALL keep only the date.

#### Scenario: Missing date
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller sends `POST /workouts` without `workoutDate`
- **THEN** the response is `400 Bad Request`
- **AND** no workout is created

#### Scenario: Date is returned as sent
- **WHEN** a caller creates a workout with `workoutDate` `2026-10-20`
- **THEN** the response body's `workoutDate` is `2026-10-20`

### Requirement: Creation returns the new workout
A successful creation SHALL respond `201 Created` with the new workout: a server-generated `id`, `name`, `description` (or `null`), `workoutDate`, `userId`, `trainerId` (or `null`), `status` and an empty `exercises` list. The response SHALL carry a `Location` header with the URL of `GET /workouts/{id}` for the new workout. The new workout SHALL be visible through `GET /workouts` to its trainer when set, to admins, and to its owner when it has no trainer. A prescribed workout SHALL stay hidden from its owner while it is `DRAFT`.

#### Scenario: Created workout is readable
- **WHEN** a caller creates a workout successfully
- **THEN** the response is `201 Created` with the workout, its `name` and `description`, `status` `DRAFT` and an empty `exercises` list
- **AND** `GET /workouts` by the caller includes a workout with that `id`

#### Scenario: Location points at the new workout
- **WHEN** a caller creates a workout successfully
- **THEN** the `Location` header ends with `/workouts/{id}` of the created workout
- **AND** following it as the same caller returns `200 OK` with that workout

#### Scenario: Prescribed draft is hidden from its owner
- **WHEN** a trainer prescribes a workout to a user
- **THEN** `GET /workouts` by that user does not include the new workout

### Requirement: A regular user creates only their own workout
When the caller has the `USER` role, the system SHALL make the caller the owner and leave the trainer empty. `userId` MAY be omitted or equal to the caller. A different `userId` or any `trainerId` SHALL be rejected with `400 Bad Request`.

#### Scenario: User creates a workout without ids
- **WHEN** a `USER` sends only `name` and `workoutDate`
- **THEN** the response is `201 Created`
- **AND** `userId` is the caller and `trainerId` is `null`

#### Scenario: User sends their own id
- **WHEN** a `USER` sends their own id as `userId`
- **THEN** the response is `201 Created` with the caller as owner

#### Scenario: User names another owner
- **WHEN** a `USER` sends another user's id as `userId`
- **THEN** the response is `400 Bad Request`
- **AND** no workout is created

#### Scenario: User names a trainer
- **WHEN** a `USER` sends any `trainerId`
- **THEN** the response is `400 Bad Request`
- **AND** no workout is created

### Requirement: A trainer prescribes workouts to regular users
When the caller has the `TRAINER` role, the system SHALL require `userId`, make it the owner and make the caller the trainer. A missing `userId`, a `userId` equal to the caller, or any `trainerId` SHALL be rejected with `400 Bad Request`.

#### Scenario: Trainer prescribes a workout
- **WHEN** a `TRAINER` sends the id of an existing `USER` as `userId`
- **THEN** the response is `201 Created`
- **AND** `userId` is that user and `trainerId` is the caller

#### Scenario: Trainer omits the owner
- **WHEN** a `TRAINER` sends no `userId`
- **THEN** the response is `400 Bad Request`

#### Scenario: Trainer targets themselves
- **WHEN** a `TRAINER` sends their own id as `userId`
- **THEN** the response is `400 Bad Request`

#### Scenario: Trainer names a trainer
- **WHEN** a `TRAINER` sends any `trainerId`
- **THEN** the response is `400 Bad Request`

### Requirement: A trainer may only prescribe to users with the USER role
When a `TRAINER` names an owner who exists but does not have the `USER` role, the system SHALL reject the request with `403 Forbidden`.

#### Scenario: Trainer targets an admin or another trainer
- **WHEN** a `TRAINER` sends the id of an existing `ADMIN` or `TRAINER` as `userId`
- **THEN** the response is `403 Forbidden`
- **AND** no workout is created

### Requirement: An admin creates workouts for other users
When the caller has the `ADMIN` role, the system SHALL require `userId` and make it the owner. A missing `userId`, or a `userId` equal to the caller, SHALL be rejected with `400 Bad Request`. Any existing user other than the caller MAY be the owner.

#### Scenario: Admin creates a workout without a trainer
- **WHEN** an `ADMIN` sends the id of another existing user as `userId` and no `trainerId`
- **THEN** the response is `201 Created`
- **AND** `userId` is that user and `trainerId` is `null`

### Requirement: Only an admin may assign a trainer, and it must be able to train

#### Scenario: Admin makes the owner their own trainer
- **WHEN** an `ADMIN` sends the same id as `userId` and `trainerId`
- **THEN** the response is `400 Bad Request`

### Requirement: The owner must exist
When the request names an owner through `userId` and no user has that id, the system SHALL reject it with `404 Not Found` after the role-dependent `400` checks.

#### Scenario: Unknown owner

- **THEN** the response is `404 Not Found`
